# Abstract

Anime is not just entertainment; it’s a global movement that shapes people’s identities
and connects fans around the world. For this project I used an AI chatbot to talk make it look like
anime fans and learn how anime affects their lives, communities, and understanding of Japanese
culture. Research shows that fans actively create and share content instead of just watching it
(McCarthy). Anime can inspire people to learn Japanese language and culture while building
connections across countries (Annett 174; “Croatian Anime and Manga Fans” 35). It spreads
through media networks and online platforms, showing how culture travels internationally
(Kovacic; Hernandez-Perez). Using an AI chatbot helped show how fans worldwide take part in
this creative and social culture, showing how media can bring people together and influence
identity.
