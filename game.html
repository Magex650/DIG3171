  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p> In the game, the player is trapped in a room by a cat that loves diamonds. 
    The cat acts like a guard and only lets the player out if all the diamonds are collected. 
    However, there is a hidden exit that allows escape without giving in to the cat’s demand. 
    This setup reflects two sides of what diamonds often mean in literature and culture: they can stand for beauty, wealth, and lasting value, but also for greed, vanity, and being trapped by material desires. 
    By giving the player a choice—either to follow the cat’s rules or find another way out—the game shows how diamonds can shape ideas about identity, values, and freedom. 
    The cat represents the pull of desire, while the secret exit shows the possibility of resisting material pressure. </p>
